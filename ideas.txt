clickable icons are pertagons with random data-rotate values
css uses attr('data-rotate) as value to transform() to slightly rotate pentagons
data-rotate is randomly assigned upon element geenration in js
the pentagon rotates back to transform(0) aligned state upon hover

pentagons can be replaces with an 'egg' with random bordr-radius so as to make it look like splash
(see shapes of css in bookmarks)
